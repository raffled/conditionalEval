## conditionalEval

This repository contains a makefile, some example code, and a tutorial
for using the Generic Preprocessor (`GPP`) to conditionally evaluate
sections of markdown source files so that lecture notes and
presentations can be compiled from the same source.

For example, posted lecture notes may contain detailed explication of
concepts, while you want the presentation slides or worksheets to only
include a skeleton of the material headings and key points.

### Getting `GPP`
`GPP` is currently (or, at least, was most recently) maintained by Tristan Miller.

Source code and information can be found at his personal site here:
[http://en.nothingisreal.com/wiki/GPP](http://en.nothingisreal.com/wiki/GPP).

### Using this software
See the
[tutorial](https://github.com/raffled/conditionalEval/blob/master/tutorial.md)
for more detailed information and example.
